/**
 * A local representation of an exception thrown by managed remote code. When exception handling is requested, exceptions
 * thrown by managed remote code will be detected by RMonoAPIFunctionAPI, and an object of this class is created and thrown
 * in the local process. This way, managed exceptions are thrown "across" the process barrier and can be handled as normal
 * C++ exceptions.
 *
 * You can get access to the managed MonoException* object by calling getMonoException(). You can then use the normal
 * RemoteMono APIs to access fields, properties or methods on this managed object to get more detailed information about
 * the exception.
